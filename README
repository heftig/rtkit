NOTES:
        RealtimeKit is a D-Bus system service that changes the
        scheduling policy of user processes/threads to SCHED_RR
        (i.e. realtime scheduling mode) on request. It is intended to
        be used as a secure mechanism to allow real-time scheduling to
        be used by normal user processes.

        RealtimeKit enforces strict policies when handing out
        real-time security to user threads:

        * Only clients with RLIMIT_RTTIME set will get RT scheduling

        * RT scheduling will only be handed out to processes with
          SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK set to guarantee that the scheduling
          settings cannot 'leak' to child processes, thus making sure
          that 'RT fork bombs' cannot be used to bypass RLIMIT_RTTIME
          and take the system down.

        * Limits are enforced on all user controllable resources, only
          a maximum number of users, processes, threads can request RT
          scheduling at the same time.

        * Only a limited number of threads may be made RT in a
          specific time frame.

        * Client authorization is verified with PolicyKit

        RealtimeKit can also be used to hand outh high priority
        scheduling (i.e. negative nice level) to user processes.

        In addition to this a-priori policy enforcement, RealtimeKit
        also provides a-posteriori policy enforcement, i.e. it
        includes a canary-based watchdog that automatically demotes
        all real-time threads to SCHED_OTHER should the system
        overload despite the logic pointed out above. For more
        information regarding canary-based RT watchdogs, see the
        Acknowledgments section below.

        In its duty to manage real-time scheduling *securely*
        RealtimeKit runs as unpriviliged user, and uses capabalities,
        resource limits and chroot() to minimize its security impact.

        RealtimeKit probably has little use in embedded or server use
        cases, use RLIMIT_RTPRIO tehre instead.

WHY:
        If processes that have real-time scheduling privileges enter a
        busy loop they can freeze the entire the system. To make sure
        such run-away processes cannot do this RLIMIT_RTTIME has been
        introduced. Being a per-process limit it is however easily
        cirumvented by combining a fork bomb with a busy loop.

        RealtimeKit hands out RT scheduling to specific threads that
        ask for it -- but only to those and due to SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK
        it can be sure that this won't 'leak'.

        In contrast to RLIMIT_RTPRIO the RealtimeKit logic makes sure
        that only a certain number of threads can be made realtime,
        per user, per process and per time interval.


CLIENTS:
        To be able to make use of realtime scheduling clients may
        request so with a small D-Bus interface that is accessible on
        the interface org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1 as object
        /org/freedesktop/RealtimeKit1 on the service
        org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1:

                void MakeThreadRealtime(u64 thread_id, u32 priority);

                void MakeThreadHighPriority(u64 thread_id, s32 priority);

        The thread IDs need to be passed as kernel tids as returned by
        gettid(), not a pthread_t! Only threads belonging to the
        calling process can be made realtime/high priority. (Please
        note that gettid() is not available in glibc, you need to
        implement that manually using syscall(). Consult the reference
        client implementation for details.)

        A BSD-licensed reference implementation of the client is
        available in rtkit.[ch] as part of the package. You may copy
        this into your sources if you wish. However given how simple
        the D-Bus interface is you might choose to implement your own
        client implementation.

        It is advisable to try acquiring realtime scheduling with
        sched_setsheduler() first, so that systems where RLIMIT_RTPRIO
        is set can be supported.

        Here's an example using the reference implementation. Replace
        this:

        <snip>
                struct sched_param p;
                memset(&p, 0, sizeof(p));
                p.sched_priority = 3;
                sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_RR|SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK, &p);
        </snip>

        by this:

        <snip>
                struct sched_param p;
                memset(&p, 0, sizeof(p));
                p.sched_priority = 3;
                if (sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_RR|SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK, &p) < 0
                        && errno == EPERM)
                        rtkit_make_realtime(system_bus, 0, p.sched_priority);
        </snip>

        But of course add more appropriate error checking! Also,
        falling back to plain SCHED_RR when SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK causes
        EINVAL migt be advisable).

DAEMON:

        The daemon is automatically started on first use via D-Bus
        system bus activation.

        Currently the daemon does not read on any configuration file,
        however it can be configured with command line parameters. You
        can edit

        /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1.service

        to set those.

        Run

        /usr/libexec/rtkit-daemon --help

        to get a quick overview on the supported parameters and their
        defaults. Many of them should be obvious in their meaning. For
        the remaining ones see below:

        --max-realtime-priority= may be used to specify the maximum
        realtime priority a client can acquire through
        RealtimeKit. Please note that this value must be smaller than
        the value passed to --our-realtime-priority=.

        --our-realtime-priority= may be used to specify the realtime
        priority of the daemon itself. Please note that this priority
        is only used for a very short time while processing a client
        request. Normally the daemon will not be running with a
        realtime scheduling policy. The real-time priorities handed
        out to the user must be lower than this value. (see above).

        --min-nice-level= may be used to specify the minimum nice
        level a client can acquire through RealtimeKit.

        --our-nice-level= may be used to specify the nice level the
        the daemon itself uses most of the time (except when
        processing requests, see above). It is probably a good idea to
        set this to a small positive value, to make sure that if the
        system is overloaded already handing out further RT scheduling
        will be delayed a bit.

        --rttime-nsec-max= may be used to control which RLIMIT_RTTIME
        value clients need to have chosen at minumum before they may
        acquire RT scheduling through RealtimeKit.

        --users-max= specifies how many users may acquire RT
        scheduling at the same time for one or multiple of their
        processes.

        --processes-per-user-max= specifies how many processes per
        user may acquire RT scheduling at the same time.

        --threads-per-user-max= specifies how many threads per user
        may acquire RT scheduling at the same time. Of course this
        value should be set higher than --process-per-user-max=.

        --actions-burst-sec= may be used to influence the rate
        limiting logic in RealtimeKit. The daemon will only pass
        realtime scheduling privileges to a maximum number of threads
        within this timeframe (see below).

        --actions-per-burst-max= may be used to influence the rate
        limiting logic in RealtimeKit. The daemon will only pass
        realtime scheduling privileges to this number of threads
        within the time frame configured via
        --actions-burst-sec=. When this limit is reached clients need
        to wait until that time passes before requesting RT scheduling
        again.

        --canary-cheep-msec= may be used to control how often the
        canary thread shall cheep.

        --canary-watchdog-msec= may be used to control how quickly the
        watchdog thread expects to receive a cheep from the canary
        thread. This value must be chosen larger than
        --canary-cheep-msec=. If the former is set 10s and the latter
        to 7s, then the canary thread can trigger and deliver the
        cheep with a maximum latency of 3s.
